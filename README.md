# SRRLibera

A free-as-in-freedom engine for playing campaigns made in Harebrained Schemes' Shadowrun series, using the Godot game engine. Does not currently exist - this page is a placeholder and a form of motivation.

TODO:
---------------
- Create a libre version of the 'decompliation' process that the official ShadowrunEditor can do to SR campaigns
  - TTY
  - GUI
- Fork AssetRipper and adapt it to specifically pull assets from the user's copy of each game
- Format everything into a Godot project
- Slowwwwly recreate the scripting of the game
  
## The Idea: 

The hope is that, eventually, there will be a single application you can run that will autodetect your gamefiles, extract them and run them in a manner similar to a DOOM SourcePort. Unfortunately, because of how likely it is that I never finish this project, the smaller convenience programs will be developed as standalone projects first and integrated into the final product. This is my first programming project of this scale, but I really enjoy the HBS Shadowrun games and I hope to make them and their vast array of campaign mods available to more people on more systemata. The first-party binaries are only available on modern, mainstream computers and game systems -- even then, the compatibility is weak, as many of the ProtonDB comments claim that the native version has significant problems like crashing and lack of audio. While Godot doesn't have nearly as much hardware support as DOOM, I hope that it helps backwards and forwards compatibility for this amazing series of games. 

## THIS PROGRAM DOES NOT COMMIT PIRACY, NOR DOES IT ENABLE IT

All game assets are sourced from the user's installation of the game. I'd personally recommend that you purchase the game on [GOG](https://www.gog.com/en/game/shadowrun_trilogy). Please do not discuss piracy in any official channels.
